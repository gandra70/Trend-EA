# Trend-EA
This is another great full operational trading expert advisor for trading, plus indikator.This Robot shows good results when tested. 
And don't lose money. But I'm not using this small EA for my trading because I have already active most advanced EA, 
which I am currently testing on my demo account. You can check how this EA trades through the following link:

So, the story is not over. My plan for the futures regarding this EA is continue. Regarding this small project. Is pretty rough and basic code. 
So, you can add more  options such as trailing stop break-even print functions, etc ...
And improve the code to be reliable and  better then ever.


Cheers
