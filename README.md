# Trend-EA
This is another great full operational EA, plus indicator. This Robot shows good results when tested. And don't lose money. But I'm not using this small EA for my trading because I have already active most advanced EA, which I am currently testing on my demo account. You can check how this EA trades through the following link: https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/629324 So, the story is not over. My plan for the futures regarding this EA is continued. Regarding this small project. Is pretty rough and basic code. So, you can add more options such as trailing stop break-even print functions, etc ... And improve the code to be reliable and better than ever.


Small advice regarding magic number. I don't believe in any magic. So, I will not spend my time, to find better number who will be involved in EA. Don't use this option. Every EA trades fairly well and without this number. If you know what you want, when you plan something to make. Then, there is no problem.


Cheers
